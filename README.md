# final-project

As my final project for the Spiced AcademyÂ´s 12-week Full Stack Web Development bootcamp I built a React application that brings together people who would like to make donations and organisations in need of these donations. After registration the organisations can make posts that are shown in the home page. Users can contact the organisations via a contact form. In addition, the registered organisations can upload profile pictures, see and delete their previous posts and view the inbox -messages sent by other users. I used Node.js/Express in the back-end side and Amazon S3 for storing the images.
